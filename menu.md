- What are hooks? - Dive into useState first, then useReducer after the break
- Custom Hooks - What? Why? How?

    - Allow us to seperate the logic with the rendering of the component, including our hooks
    and create a custom hook

    3 rules for custom hooks
    1. It needs to be a javascript function
    2. when we import it, it needs to be called at the top of our functional component
    3. it needs to start with the word `use`

- useState, useReducer, and useEffect (If time permits)
